# AI Alienates Humans

## 1. Claim  
AI hiring tools depersonalize recruitment, treating candidates like numbers and creating frustrating, isolating experiences that damage trust in employers.  

## 2. Evidence  
- **Chipotle’s AI "Ava Cado"**:  
  - Scheduled interviews at stores with **no open positions**, leaving candidates stranded (e.g., Evalyn Mendoza’s experience).  
  - Managers reported AI booking appointments outside their availability (Reddit posts).  
- **Candidate frustration**: Mendoza called AI interactions "less personal" and said it "treats people like a number."  
- **Stanford economist**: AI hiring risks harming company reputation and alienating younger workers.  

## 3. Reasoning  
- **Lack of human oversight**: AI chatbots can’t verify store needs or adjust for errors, leading to wasted time for candidates.  
- **Opaque communication**: Candidates can’t negotiate or clarify details (e.g., location, role specifics) with a chatbot.  
- **Focus on speed over quality**: AI prioritizes filling roles fast, ignoring candidate experience.  

## 4. Impact  
- **Damages employer reputation**: Negative experiences spread online (e.g., Reddit forums), deterring top talent.  
- **Increases candidate distrust**: 73% of job seekers say poor hiring experiences affect their brand loyalty (LinkedIn).  
- **Worsens labor alienation**: Young workers already feel disconnected from workplaces—AI adds to the disillusionment.  

## Rebutal  
1. **They say…** AI improves efficiency with high satisfaction rates (e.g., 89% positive ratings at Chipotle).  
2. **But…** Satisfaction surveys only capture completed applications—not candidates ghosted or misled by AI errors.  
3. **Because…** Mendoza and others faced systemic issues (e.g., fake interviews) that stats overlook.  
4. **Therefore…** AI’s “efficiency” comes at the cost of human dignity, risking long-term talent loss for short-term gains.
