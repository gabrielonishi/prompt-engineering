# Enhanced Efficiency and Scalability

## 1. Claim  
AI hiring tools like conversational assistants dramatically improve efficiency and scalability, enabling companies to process millions of candidates faster while reducing costs.  

## 2. Evidence  
- **Challenge**: GM received 1–2 million candidates yearly, needing 55+ recruiters just to schedule interviews (5–7 days per candidate).  
- **Solution**: AI assistant "Ev-e" automated screening/scheduling via text/chat.  
- **Results**:  
  - Scheduling time reduced from **5 days to 29 minutes**.  
  - **74,000+ interviews** automated with zero recruiter effort.  

## 3. Reasoning  
- **Automation eliminates bottlenecks**: AI handles repetitive tasks humans struggle to scale.  
- **24/7 availability**: Candidates engage on their terms (e.g., texting), speeding up hiring.  
- **Cost-effective**: Reduces need for large recruiter teams to manage volume.  

## 4. Impact  
- Faster hiring = secure top talent before competitors.  
- Recruiters focus on strategic tasks (e.g., interviews) instead of admin work.  
- Scalable for global companies with high applicant volumes.  

## Rebutal  
1. **They say…** AI causes alienation by removing the "human touch" in hiring.  
2. **But…** GM’s AI actually **improved candidate experience** with instant, 24/7 communication (e.g., texting vs. waiting days for emails).  
3. **Because…** 73% of job seekers say slow processes worsen their experience (LinkedIn 2023)—speed and convenience matter most. 
4. **Therefore…** AI enhances, not replaces, human interaction by letting recruiters focus on meaningful engagement (e.g., interviews).
