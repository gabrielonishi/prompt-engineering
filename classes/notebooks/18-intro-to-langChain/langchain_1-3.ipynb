        "— Harrison Chase, co-founder of LangChain\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, an agent is a system that uses a language model to determine the control flow of an application.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of LangChain, agents are components that use language models to make decisions about which actions to take and in what order. Unlike chains, where the sequence of actions is predefined, agents use the language model as a reasoning engine to dynamically decide the actions to be taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangChain agents are designed to interact with various tools, process inputs, and generate meaningful outputs. Instead of providing static responses, agents follow a looped structure to perform reasoning and iterative steps until the desired output is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "This dynamic approach allows agents to handle complex queries and adapt to different scenarios, making them essential components for building more intelligent and adaptable AI applications."

        "\n",

        "By default, the decorator uses the function name as the tool name, but this can be overridden by passing a string as the first argument. In addition, it uses the function’s docstring as the tool’s description — so it’s mandatory to provide an appropriate docstring.\n",

        "In the cell below, we define a simple function called `time`, which returns the current time. As mentioned, when using the `@tool` decorator, it’s important to define both the docstring and input/output type annotations, as this information is automatically passed to the agent so it knows what the tool does and how to use it.\n",
