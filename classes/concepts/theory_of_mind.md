# Theory of Mind (ToM)

Refers to a models ability to understand and reason about the mental state of others. Understand the world from the perspective of a person instead of its own or from reality.

It is still not known if models actually developed ToM or if they just recognized patterns in training data.

### Tasks that require ToM

**Understanding different perspectives:** If a text describes two characters with conflicting information, a model with ToM could understand that each character believes something different, even if one belief is factually incorrect.
> Example: "Alice thinks the keys are in the drawer, but Bob saw her put them on the table." A model with ToM could identify that Alice has a false belief about the keys' location.

**Inferring intentions and goals:** It could understand why a character in a story performs a certain action by inferring their underlying desires or intentions.
> Example: "John wanted to surprise Mary, so he hid the gift." The model could infer John's intention (to surprise Mary) based on his action (hiding the gift) and his stated desire

**Recognizing emotions and their causes:** It could potentially understand the emotional states of individuals based on the context and infer what might have caused those emotions.
> Example: "Sarah frowned after reading the email." A model with ToM might infer that the email contained bad news, causing Sarah to feel negative emotions.

**Handling figurative language and social cues:** ToM could help in understanding sarcasm, irony, or indirect requests by recognizing the speaker's underlying mental state or intention, which might differ from the literal meaning of the words.
> Example (Sarcasm): "Oh, great," John said, after spilling coffee all over himself. A model with ToM might recognize that John doesn't actually think it's great but is expressing frustration.
