In this activity, you will generate a dataset with at least 500 entries, related to a company's customer service operations.

Instructions:

 - Work with AI to ensure the dataset is diverse and not overly repetitive.
 - Keep in mind that AI tends to be overly positive; adjust satisfaction ratings to reflect a more realistic distribution. Not all customers give maximum scores.
 - Ensure that problem descriptions and customer feedback vary, as it is rare for two people to respond with exactly the same wording.
 - The dataset must be submitted in Excel (.xlsx) format.
 - The conversation should also be submitted
 - Do not use real data in the dataset.

Rubric

    The assignment is well-organized, making it easy to distinguish between prompts and LLM responses.
    The prompts effectively guide the LLM toward achieving the assignmentâ€™s goal.
    The prompts are clearly written, free of spelling errors, and structured in a way that ensures the LLM understands the user's intent.
    The prompts do not copy parts of the assignment but are written to guide the LLM toward the desired outcome.
